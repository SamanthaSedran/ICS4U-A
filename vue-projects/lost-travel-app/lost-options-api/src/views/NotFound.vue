        <h1>Not Found</h1>

            (Mr. DesLauriers, this was not directed at you, I just thought this would be really funny to include on a not found page for a website :)

            Idiot, do not search for pages that we haven't listed!!!
            There is a reason that we haven't listen them.
            Go back to the main menu and follow the instructions!:
            <router-link to="/">home</router-link>
        </p>
